            Father of 3 humans, 5 unicorns & 2 dogs,I design since I can
            remember it. I often get asked where I get my inspiration from: in
            everyday’s lil’ details. And sometimes in leftover food I find in my
            beard.

            When I was 5, I got adbucted by a unicorn family. When they returned
            me to earth, I joined a designer school. But, fo’ real, what I
            learned with my kidnaptive family really gave an edge to my creative
            language.

            Being a human is way too complicated. Time to be a unicorn.

            Try it and you’ll see. Then your Figma files are just gonna fly in
